# Getting Started

## Install json-server

You have to run it, if you do not have json-server yet

```npm install -g json-server```

## Start the application

In the project directory, you can run:

```npm install```

After that, in main terminal you have to run `npm start`

Also, you need to go to `src/js-server/` and run `json-server generate.js --port 3004` in different terminal

Then, in [Users] (http://localhost:3004/users) you could pick anyone you want and log in with his username and password
